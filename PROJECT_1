2. Define GIT repository

Repositories in GIT contain a collection of files of various different versions of a Project. These files are imported from the repository into the user's local serverfor further updations and
modifications in the file's content. A VCS or the Version Control System is used to create these versions and store them in a specific place termed a repository. The process of copying the content from
an existing Git Repository with the help of various Git Tools is termed cloning. Once the cloning process is done, the user gets the complete repository on his local machine. Git by default
assumes the work to be done on the repository is as a user, once the cloning is done.Users can also create a new repository or delete an existing repository. To delete a
repository, the simpler way is to just delete the folder containing the repository. Repositories can be divided into two types based on the usage on a server.
